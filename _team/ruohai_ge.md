â€‹Hi, nice to meet you! I'm Ruohai, a Master's student at Carnegie Mellon University's Robotics Institute. My research interests involve localization, 360 camera stitching, and computer vision. Currently, I'm working on the open-research drone project and the 360 camera localization project. I previously graduated from Carnegie Mellon University with a B.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering and a double major in Robotics.
