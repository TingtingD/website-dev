with team CoSTAR in the DARPA Subterranean Challenge where his work focused on
aerial navigation in challenging, underground environments.
Micah received his Ph.D. also from CMU in 2020.
His thesis focused on autonomous exploration for mapping of three-dimensional
environments as well as perception planning with multi-robot teams.
